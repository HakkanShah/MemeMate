# **App Name**: Desi MemeMatch

## Core Features:

- Meme Feed Display: Display memes in a masonry grid with comic-style borders, captions, author info, reactions (😂 🙏 💀 😭 💘), and timestamps.
- Profile Presentation: Present user profiles as 'Indian meme bios' with meme avatars/desi faces, humor tags, meme genres, status, bio, and quiz result.
- Swipe & Match Simulation: Simulate a Tinder-style swipe system where users can swipe left/right on user profiles. Upon a mutual swipe, create a match.
- Comic Chat Interface: Provide a comic-style chat interface with speech bubbles. Allow users to send emoji and sticker replies in real-time.
- Meme Compatibility Quiz: Design an onboarding quiz that defines a user's humor profile and meme preferences. Store the quiz results in the user profile.
- Dummy Data Generation: Generate dummy data for users, memes, matches and chats so the app feels alive for demonstration purposes
- Humor Tag Tool: Given some existing content from the user, recommend up to 3 humor tags that match the tone of that content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Meme Yellow (#FFDA63) to capture the fun and chaotic energy of memes.
- Background color: Desaturated Yellow (#F2E7C6), providing a light base that doesn't distract from the content. This maintains the comic vibe.
- Accent color: Jio Blue (#12B8FF) to highlight interactive elements and CTAs. Its higher saturation contrasts effectively with the Meme Yellow.
- Font: 'Bangers' (sans-serif) for headlines, for a bold and comic book aesthetic.
- Font: 'Baloo Bhai' (sans-serif) for body, which complements Bangers.
- Use desi-themed emoji and meme avatars to populate user profiles and reactions, reinforcing the Indian meme culture.
- Implement jagged borders, panels, and speech bubbles to give the app a comic book style.
- Employ meme-like animations such as meme shakes on hover, emoji bounces on reaction, and page flip/boom effects during transitions.
