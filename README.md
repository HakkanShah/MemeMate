# MemeMate 😎❤️

A fun, meme-powered social dating mock‑app built with Next.js and organized in a modern modular structure.

## 🌐 Live Demo  
Check out the deployed app here:  
👉 **[MemeMate Web App](https://mememate.netlify.app/)**  
Hosted on **Netlify**

## 🚀 Project Overview  
**MemeMate** is a meme‑centric social dating UI prototype. Designed for meme lovers to *swipe, react, and match* based on humor preferences, it’s a quirky showcase of interactive frontend work and creative interface design.

> ⚠️ This is a frontend-only dummy project.  
> In the future, I will add a **backend**, **database**, and all the necessary features to make the app fully functional for real users. Stay tuned!

## 💡 Why This Exists  

MemeMate was built as a creative side project to explore frontend architecture, swipe interfaces, and humor-driven design. Even in its current dummy state, it serves as a cool portfolio piece and proof-of-concept for a meme-based social platform.
